## What is Git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## What is Github?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## So, what's the difference between Git and Github?

In summary, Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, as well as additional collaboration and project management features.

## Branching

1. **Create a new branch:** In GitHub, you can create a new branch by clicking on the "Branch" dropdown menu and typing in a name for your new branch. This will create a new branch that is identical to the current branch (usually the main branch, also called "master" or "main").

2. **Make changes:** Once you've created your new branch, you can start making changes to the code. These changes will only affect the new branch, and will not be visible in the main branch until you merge the two branches together.

3. **Commit changes:** As you make changes, you'll need to commit them to the new branch using Git. You can do this either through the command line or through the GitHub user interface.

4. **Merge changes:** Once you're ready to merge the changes from your new branch back into the main branch, you can do so through the GitHub interface. This will bring up a "pull request", which allows you to review the changes and make sure everything looks good before merging.

5. **Resolve conflicts:** Sometimes, when you merge two branches together, there may be conflicts between the changes made in each branch. GitHub provides tools to help you resolve these conflicts and merge the changes together in a way that makes sense.

Overall, branching in GitHub allows you to experiment with new ideas and make changes to your code without affecting the main branch of development. It's an essential feature for collaborative development, as it allows multiple people to work on different parts of the codebase at the same time without stepping on each other's toes.
